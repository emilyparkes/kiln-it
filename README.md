# kiln it
A project that will allow me to keep records of my clay creations. Including type of creation, percent shrinkage the status of firing. A platform for friends and whƒÅnau to be able to see a catalog of all the creations I've made and the process they went through. 

Using fullstack technologies I have learned and mentor others in, as well as being a project to try out new tech in more complex scenarios.
