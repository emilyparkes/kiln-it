        <p>Hello! I am the person behind Dirty Hands Studio. Doing pottery has been a fun hobby of mine for a wee while and I have been lucky enough to inherit my grandmothers pottery wheel. This site is a way for me to share my creations with friends and whanau over the world and sell a few pieces here and there via instagram too. </p>
        <p>This is why showing the progress of my pieces through some of the photos has been important to me. Appreciating the stages and work gone into the creations that get seen at the end. I hope for it also to be a reflection of my learning journey too. A way to look back and appreciate. </p>
        <p>Enjoy!</p>
